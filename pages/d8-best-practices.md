# Best practices
Drupal 8 has specific workflow requirements. If you already use Drupal and Git, quickly skimming this learning path will help you tweak your habits, concepts and tools. If Drupal and/or Git are new to you, work your way through this learning path methodically, paying close attention to the details. Sometimes the minor-seeming stuff is actually indispensable.

No matter your starting point, pretty soon you will be able to:
* Employ essential git commands without an extra thought
* Explain the hows and whys of each critical server instance to your team
* Move and track your code across each of your repositories and machines
* Manage changes to configuration

## Why Git? Seems like an unnecessary hurdle to learn
Make no mistake. This boat is the one you want to be on. Every serious web development team now uses [Git](http://git-scm.com) to manage code [versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and deployment, and for all the right reasons.

### Set achievable goals for learning Git
As important as Git skills are to your success as a developer, you only need 6 to start. Don't lose velocity on either your project or your learning objectives by diving into Git (any more than you would learn about building roads as part of learning to ride a bike; both civil engineering and Git are fascinating studies).

<!-- @link, "url" : "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png", "text": "I understand I should learn just 6 git commands per month. In the short term, I'll handle complexity by re-cloning the remote repository." -->

Next, it's important to highlight what learners should get out of your course.  For example, pretty soon you will be able to:

* Fork your own copy of this template learning repository
* Publish your own path into Outlearn
* Enrich your Markdown with things like _Todos_ or _Unfurled Links_

Make sure to set the right expectations about time and effort as well. For example, this sample path is quite short, no more than 5 minutes.  Of course, if you decide to start working on your own path, there's no telling...time stands still when a great developer gets deep in the flow!

No matter what kind of a role you are in, you are most likely teaching people. That includes on-boarding a new colleague, mentoring a junior developer, managing a team, or spreading the word about an open source project. We bet that we can make it easier for you to do some of that teaching. Go on and give it a try.
