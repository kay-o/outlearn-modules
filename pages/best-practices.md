# Best practices
Drupal 8 has specific workflow requirements. Fulfilling them with the right action at the right time will take new habits, skills and tools. Even if you already know Drupal 7 and/or Git, take a trip down this learning path to grab new information.

* Identify essential git commands & concepts
* Confirm the hows and whys of each server instance
* Code
* Configuration

h2. Why Git? Seems like an unnecessary hurdle to learn.
Make no mistake. This boat is the one you want to be on. Every serious web development team now uses [Git](http://git-scm.com) to manage code [versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) and deployment, and for all the right reasons.

Next, it's important to highlight what learners should get out of your course.  For example, pretty soon you will be able to:

* Fork your own copy of this template learning repository
* Publish your own path into Outlearn
* Enrich your Markdown with things like _Todos_ or _Unfurled Links_

Make sure to set the right expectations about time and effort as well. For example, this sample path is quite short, no more than 5 minutes.  Of course, if you decide to start working on your own path, there's no telling...time stands still when a great developer gets deep in the flow!

No matter what kind of a role you are in, you are most likely teaching people. That includes on-boarding a new colleague, mentoring a junior developer, managing a team, or spreading the word about an open source project. We bet that we can make it easier for you to do some of that teaching. Go on and give it a try.
