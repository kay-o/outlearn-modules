# Best practices
Every serious web development team now uses [Git|http://git-scm.com] to manage code [versions|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control] and deployment.

Next, it's important to highlight what learners should get out of your course.  For example, pretty soon you will be able to:

* Fork your own copy of this template learning repository
* Publish your own path into Outlearn
* Enrich your Markdown with things like _Todos_ or _Unfurled Links_

Make sure to set the right expectations about time and effort as well. For example, this sample path is quite short, no more than 5 minutes.  Of course, if you decide to start working on your own path, there's no telling...time stands still when a great developer gets deep in the flow!

No matter what kind of a role you are in, you are most likely teaching people. That includes on-boarding a new colleague, mentoring a junior developer, managing a team, or spreading the word about an open source project. We bet that we can make it easier for you to do some of that teaching. Go on and give it a try.

Cheers,  
The Outlearn Team
